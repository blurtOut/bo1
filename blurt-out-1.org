What's your story?

You can't speak! You can't understand! You feel bad! You feel hopeless!

That's crazy! Cheer up!

It's not the end of the world.

Speaking English is a piece of cake.

Don't look back. Enjoy losing face. Just forget about your face.

The more mistakes you make, the more progress you make.

Don't give up.

Just try your best.

Relax! Don't panic! Take it easy!

Be patient and enjoy yourself.

Learning English should be fun.

Speaking good English is no big deal.

It's worth your time and effort.

It's an easy job. Do something about it. You have no choice. No more excuses!

Get moving. Let's get started! Let's talk in English! You'd better do it now.

I have every confidence in you. I want to be proud of you.

It's my pleasure to help you anytime.

You can count on me!

Don't worry about it, I'm serious.

I'll try my best to help you.

We will make it together.

Dear Miss Know-it-all

亲爱的万事通先生

In 1997, when I was finishing college, I met a beautiful girl and we became good
friends.

在我 1997 年大学毕业之际，我遇上了一位漂亮的女孩并成为了好朋友。

After graduation we kept in touch through letters

毕业后，我们一直保持着书信来往。

Gradually I found I was in love with her.

渐渐地，我发觉我爱上了她。

As a result, I refused the advances of another woman I knew in my office, and at
that point, I realized I should make my feelings known to the woman I loved.

结果，我拒绝了办公室一位女孩的求爱，与此同时，我认识到应该让我所爱的人知道我的感情。

I wrote a letter to her expressing my love. She responded right away.

于是，我写了一封信向她表达我的爱意。她很快就给我回信了。

To my great disappointment, she refused my love, saying she had always thought
of me as her big brother, and that she just enjoyed exchanging ideas and
thoughts with me.

让我失望至极的是，她拒绝了我。她说，她一直都把我当成是大哥哥，只是喜欢与我交流思想而已。

I am in so much pain now and don't know what to do.

我现在伤心极了，不知道如何是好。

Should I continue to keep in touch with her or forget her and disappear from her
life?

我应该继续与她联系呢？还是忘记她、从她的视线中消失？

I hope that I can get some advice from big sister Miss Know-it-all. 我希望万事通
大姐能给我一些建议。

Dear Li Yang

亲爱的李阳

On a pain scale of one to ten, unrequited love, or love that is given but not
returned can be right up there just above an operation or a visit to the
dentist. It is much worse than both. Medical procedures tend to heal
quickly. But broken hearts can take years to heal and sometimes never do.

在大大小小的痛楚中，单相思或没有回报的爱所带来的痛楚和手术或看牙医后的痛相比，前
两者更甚于后两者。医疗手段可以很快治愈肉体的创伤，而破碎的心却需要多年才能复原，
有时甚至终生也难以愈合。

Most of us have our first run in/encounter/experience with unrequited love in
our late teens during high school.

大多数人都有过十八九岁在学校里时单相思的经历。

We watch from afar as our truly beloved wanders the halls of the school.

远远地看着自己所爱的人在学校大礼堂漫步。

We make every effort to spend as much time with that person as possible.

想方设法地尽可能与心仪的人呆在一起。

We also make every effort to be sure that person does not know how in love we
really are.

我们也会力图把爱埋在心底，不让对方知道我们是多么的爱她。

But that is no way to go through life.

然而，我们总不能就这样度过一生。

So then comes the inevitable/unavoideble day when we have watched "Titanic" too
many times or listened to too much Celine Dion, and we get up our courage and go
to them in a dramatic flurry, and confess our true feelings.

因此，在那个迟早都要面临的日子里当看了无数次“铁达尼号”和听了无数遍席林迪翁的歌以
后，我们终于鼓起勇气在忐忑不安中走向她们，袒露我们的情感。

A couple of hours later it is all over with, and all we want to do is turn back
time and go back to admiring them from afar.

几小时之后，一切都已结束，我们唯一所希望的就是让时光倒流，回到远远地赞赏她们的那个时候。

We want to go back to the sweet taste of our fantasies, thinking how wonderful
it will be when we can be together.

回到我们甜美的梦境中，想着有多么的美妙能与她在一起。

We want to go back there because rejection leaves a bad taste in our mouths that
we can never quite get rid of.

我们想回到从前，只因她的拒绝在我们心中留下的阴影挥之不去。

My advice to you is let her go. You can't force her to fall in love with you.

我的建议是由她去。你不可能强迫她爱上你。

The only thing wrose is begging her to love you.

更差的是企求她爱你。

It is difficult for me to even advise you to maintain your good friendship with
her, because much like being on teeter-totter with someone heavier than
yourself, things will just never be even/balanced/equal.

我甚至难以建议你继续保持与她的友谊，因为对我来说这是一件很难的事，这叫你与一个比
你重许多的人玩跷跷板没什么区别，结果都是不可能的。

I hope you feel better and I wish you the best of luck!

希望我所说的对你有帮助，祝你好运！

Sincerely,
Miss Know-it-all
