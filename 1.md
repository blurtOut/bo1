What's your story? 

You can't speak! You can't understand! You feel bad! You feel hopeless! 

That's crazy! Cheer up!

It's not the end of the world. 

Speaking English is a piece of cake.

Don't look back. Enjoy losing face. Just forget about your face.

The more mistakes you make, the more progress you make. 

Don't give up.

Just try your best. 

Relax! Don't panic! Take it easy!

Be patient and enjoy yourself. 

Learning English should be fun.

Speaking good English is no big deal. 

It's worth your time and effort.

It's an easy job. Do something about it. You have no choice. No more excuses!

Get moving. Let's get started! Let's talk in English! You'd better do it now.

I have every confidence in you. I want to be proud of you.

It's my pleasure to help you anytime. 

You can count on me! 

Don't worry about it, I'm serious.

I'll try my best to help you. 

We will make it together.
